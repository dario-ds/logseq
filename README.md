# Logseq

Using this repo share some Logseq templates and CSS with the world ðŸ™‚

It's updated every so often as different parts of my system crystallize, although my main focus is in updating Logseq Mastery materials.

## Templates

To use these templates, download the 'templates.md' file and copy it to the 'pages' folder in your Logseq root folder.

Then in Logseq, bring up the desired template by using the forward slash command '/'.

And that's it!

## CSS

Navigate to your **Settings** menu. Select **'Edit custom.css'**, copy and paste this into the CSS editor. Voila :)

**Huge thanks to Alex Qwxlea** for showing me how it's done and getting me started on  CSS.
